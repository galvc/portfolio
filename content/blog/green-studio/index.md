#Description
This is a personal project meant for me to learn and understand how React works. I created an ecommerce website 
that sells indoor houseplants. 

#Learnings
- This project taught me how to think in React and use ES6 
- Creating an ecommerce website and thinking in React is much more difficult than I thought. There are many types 
of implementations and ways to provide a single action.
- I experienced the advantages and disadvantages of CSS-in-JS and styled-components. They each have their strengths.
However I believe it is impossible to find consistency in CSS-in-JS
- Creating an app in React isn't as straightforward as coding in HTML. There is a certain way to more effectively and efficiently 
start and develop an app.


##What I can improve
- popups in the same page while feeding information and state across the app
- better state management
- learn effective React thinking
- consistent CSS 
- a roadmap of beginning to end development
- back-end development and information storage
